								<title>My Executive Summary</title>
								<body>
									<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
									<p>As a senior at Seton Hill University, I have had many opportunities to showcase my talents and expand my horizons. As an intern within the IT department at school (during the fall of 2021), I learned the basics of computer networking and databases. I dealt with day-to-day activities in the office and was trusted with confidential client and company information.
 
										Over holiday breaks, I also worked part-time at a supermarket chain, Giant Eagle. From this experience, I gained valuable customer service skills. I ensured inventory was filled on the sales floor to maximize sales and improve the customer experience. I also had one on one interaction with customers when delivering groceries to the car when doing Curbside Express. 
										My volunteer experience included work at Christian Layman Thrift Store located in Greensburg, PA. I have also volunteered with programs such as the YMCA, a Fish Fry, and various activities around campus.  These experiences allowed me to give back to my community while I honed valuable skills such as time management, and verbal communications.
										
										I am currently a Computer Science major with minors in Criminal Justice and Cyber Defense.  I am currently involved in Alpha Phi Sigma , the international honor society for Criminal Justice majors. I am also involved in many other clubs; one is the American Cancer Society, where I have taken part in lots of fundraisers to raise money for cancer. With my work experience, community service, school, and extracurricular activities, I am still graduating on time of the four years. 
										This portfolio highlights different projects I have completed throughout my educational and professional career. Throughout my portfolio, I will exhibit a variety of skills and abilities that could be valuable to your organization.  In it you will be able to access my resume and see a video on who I am as a professional.
